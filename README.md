The KaiNC V1 is a fully custom CNC Mill designed to mill aluminum and small steel parts. It's relatively cheap to build at around $700, and it's pretty simple to build for hobby-ists and hackers. I've also documented all 100 hours of design in the JOURNAL.md to inspire others to build even cooler mills.

## Custom Features
- Fully aluminum frame made out of extrusion and stock pieces.
- SF1204 and 1610 ball-screws with supports and couplers
- HGH15CA rails for rigid support
- NEMA23 steppers with PETG supports and jaw couplers
- 1.5KW air cooled spindle for aluminum and mild steel
- Easily assemblable with T-Nuts and nuts/bolts
- 350x350mm bed with around 140mm of Z travel
- Rigid fixed gantry design

## CAD Design

I used Onshape to design all of my parts. All the holes are layed out in the design so it's pretty easy to assemble using basic sense, but I'm going to improve the fine details pretty soon.
